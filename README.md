# An Oracle to allow Pandemic-aware Policies

**Purpose:**
The covid-19 pandemic has caused widespread uncertainly for people and small businesses who feel the financial impact of the pandemic due to government restrictions, reduced customers numbers and spending power. Legal agreements are in many cases not well equipped to dynamically respond to restrictions and legislation. Tenancy agreements and Insurance contract, in particular, Business Interruption insurance is sometimes not clear and comprehensive in the handling of the current situation. The adoption of potential local and regional restrictions, that adapt based on local infection rates and risk factors mean that contracts need to be based on an trusted source of data, a agreed set of data schemas and a legal lexicon that can add clarity to legal agreements. The combination of these elements can lead to a fair and transparent set of legal agreements that can add clarity to an uncertain future.

* Pandemics (such as COVID-19)
